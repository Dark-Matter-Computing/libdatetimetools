   released version 1.0.10 of DocketMaster

     Change log:
        -Added: I added the islastweek function in the datetools.c file and the prototype in the datetools.h file.
        -Updated: I started working on the isholiday function, but have commented it out for the moment.
        -Added: Several new #defines in the datetools.h and ruleprocessor.h files to deal with "magic" numbers for weeks and other codes.
        -Applied: I re-opened the datetools.c file for compliation.
