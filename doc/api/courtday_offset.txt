void courtday_offset(struct DateTime *orig_date, struct DateTime *calc_date, int numdays);    datetools.h    Date Computations
        [ ] Description: calculates the number of courtdays between two dates. Court
        [ ] days exclude weekends and holidays.  So the offset does not count those
        [ ] days.
        [ ] Parameters: The starting date, the number of court days to count, and a
        [ ] pointer to another DateTime struct to store the result.
        [ ] Return: No return, but the function changes the value of the variable
        [ ] calc_date (the resulting date) through use of the pointer.
