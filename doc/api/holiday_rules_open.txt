Feature: Open a calendaring rules document, so that I can process rules.

Scenario:
Given
When
Then

Parameters: const char *receivedrulefilename
            int close_on_success

Returns: int

Preconditions: The *receivedrulefilename is not null and points to a valid file name string.

Postconditions: A valid holiday rule file is opened; or
                An error is generated because the file cannot be opened.

Potential errors:
                    Normal file errors: file does not exist; file cannot be opened; etc.
                    
                    rule file opens fine, but is not valid. —>
                    holiday_rules_validate_file does not process errors, but
                    will return an (unhandled) error. So, this function
                    kick-offs the error handling for each area where errors
                    can occur Presently, if the file name is null, it just
                    exits. In non-interactive mode, that should still be
                    fine. In interactive and gui modes, it should re-request
                    a file name. This means I have to add a “mode” setting
                    and the library must be made aware of it.
