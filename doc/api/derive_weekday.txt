Feature: Calculate the day of the week.

Scenario:   I need to know the day of the week that a particular date falls
Given:      I have a complete date with year, month, and day.
When:       The date is between September 14, 1752 and December 31, 9999
Then:       This function calculates the day of the week, using Sakamoto's formula

Parameters: const struct DateTime *dt
            
Returns: int representing the day of the week.

Preconditions:  The pointer to the DateTime struct is not null, the fields in the DateTime struct
                have a non-null day, month, and year; the day month and year are between September 14, 1752
                and December 31, 9999.

Postconditions: function returns an integer that corresponds to one of the days in enum DAYS

Potential errors:   dt is null
                    *dt->year > 9999
                    *dt->year < 1752
                    *dt->year == 1752 && *dt->month < September
                    *dt->year == 1752 && *dt->month == September && *dt->day < 14
                    *dt->year == [not set]
                    *dt->month == [not set]
                    *dt->day == [not set]
