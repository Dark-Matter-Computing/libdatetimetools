holiday_rules_validatefile    datetimetools_pvt.h
        [ ] Parameters
            [ ] FILE *candidaterulefile_h
        [ ] Returns
            [ ] int
        [ ] Return Values
            [ ] 0 =
            [ ] [x] = Not a Court Holiday Rule File
            [ ] [x] = Deprecated version of the Holiday Rules File
                Perhaps create a function that will update an old rules file
            [ ] [x] = fields wrong
            [ ] [x] = data formatted incorrectly. [brainstorm ways so that I might be able to provide more diagnostic information]
                This might need to be moved elsewhere. Presently this validation function only checks that there is a row of fields and a version number.
