        [ ] days between two dates or the number of days before or after a
        [ ] specified date. This function does the opposite of the jdn2greg
        [ ] function.

        [ ] Return: Returns an integer with the Julian Date.  Usually this number is
        [ ] not stored for "permanent use" but is used as an argument for
        [ ] another function, such as the date_offset function.
